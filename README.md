# Space-Invaders
Hi Guys,

This is a vanilla-js game, you've to shoot down every invaders to Win. 

There are around 30 **invaders** and they keepon moving all the way to you, you can you the *side arrow keys* to move left and right and use your spacebar to shoot.

For creating a local copy of the project all you've to do is to fork it and then clone it on your machine.

Please create issue if you've any ideas to make it better.

Thank You.
